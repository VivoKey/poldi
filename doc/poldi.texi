@node Overview
@section Overview

Poldi is package consisting of a PAM module, which implements
authentication via OpenPGP smartcards, and a maintaince tool named
poldi-ctrl.

Poldi expects a 1:1 mapping between Unix accounts and smartcards; this
mapping can be established with the help of poldi-ctrl.

@node Building
@section Building

Building Poldi should be pretty straightforward; Poldi depends on the
following packages: Libgcrypt, Libgpg-error.

Details on the build procedure can be found in the file ``INSTALL''.

@node Using Poldi
@chapter Using Poldi

In this chapter you will find information on the correct configuration
and Usage of Poldi.

* Testing::                     Testing basic functionality
@end menu

@node Configuration
@section Configuration

All configuration files of Poldi are stored beneath
``@code{sysconfdir}/poldi''.

Poldi's main configuration file is
``@code{sysconfdir}/poldi/poldi.conf''.  The syntax of this
configuration file is identical to the one used by several other GnuPG
components; options, and their values, are written next each other,
seperated by a whitespace - one such configuration item per line.

Poldi supports the following options:

@table @code
@item ctapi-driver <driver name>
@item pcsc-driver <driver name>
@item reader-port <reader port>
@item disable-ccid
@item disable-opensc
@item debug-ccid-driver
@item fake-wait-for-card
@item logfile
@end table

The semantics used by Poldi in respect to choosing a default card
driver and handling of the card driver specific options should match
those of scdaemon.

The public keys are stored in files beneath the directory
``keys''. which are named after the card serial numbers.  These files
have to contain the public key as a single S-Expression.

The mapping between keys and Unix accounts is to be established by
adding appropriate entries to the user database file named ``users''.
Such an entry has to be of the following form:

<card serial number> <white space(s)> <account>.

Maintaining the information in these files can be simplified by using
the Poldi maintaince tool.

An example follows.

The user ``bender'', who got a OpenPGP card with the serial number
``D2760001240101000001000000CF0000'', would like to authenticate
himself through Poldi.  First, the system administrator of the system
in question has to introduce ``bender'' to Poldi:

$ poldi-ctrl --add-user --account bender --serialno D2760001240101000001000000CF0000.

That's it.  Now, bender has to write the public key of his OpenPGP
card into the appropriate key file:

$ poldi-ctrl --set-key



@node Testing
@section Testing

After configuring Poldi properly, basic functionality should be tested
prior to integrating the PAM module into the system.

In order to test basic card access, poldi-ctrl can be used as follows
to dump information read from the card:

$ poldi-ctrl --dump

After verifying the correct interaction with the card, poldi-ctrl
should be used to simulate an authentication mechanism:

$ poldi-ctrl --test

If this works as well, Poldi should be ready for integration into the
PAM system.
