@node Overview
@chapter Overview

Poldi is a PAM module implementing challenge/response based
authentication through the OpenPGP
smartcard@footnote{http://www.g10code.de/p-card.html}.  It makes use of
several GnuPG components@footnote{Libgcrypt, Assuan, Scdaemon, Dirmngr}
and currently supports two authentication methods:

@table @asis
@item ``local-database'' authentication method

This method establishs the mapping between user accounts and
smartcards through a locally administered database.

@item ``X509'' authentication

This method uses the PKI infrastructure provided by Dirmngr for
validating certificates.  OpenPGP smartcards are associated with X509
certificates through the smartcard's ``url'' field; the user account
name to use for authentication is extracted from the certificate.
@end table

This manual is primarily intended for system administrators interested
in setting up authentication through PAM Poldi.

@node Authentication methods
@chapter Authentication methods

This chapter explains the supported authentication methods in detail.

@menu
* Local-database authentication::
* X509 authentication::
@end menu

@node Local-database authentication
@section Local-database authentication

The login process through local database authentication consists
essentially of three parts: looking up the smartcards key on the local
computer, figuring out the desired identity for the login and finally
doing challenge/response authentication against the local key.

Poldi maintains a database, which associates local user accounts with
smartcards (through their serial number).  One smartcard can be
associated with many users and one user can be associated with many
smartcards.

The public keys are stored in files in a subdirectory named
``keys''. The files are named after the card serial numbers and must
contain the public key as a single S-Expression as it is printed out
by poldi-ctrl.

The mapping between keys and Unix accounts is to be established by
adding appropriate entries to the user database file named ``users''.
Such an entry is of the following form:

@example
<card serial number> <white space(s)> <account>.
@end example

@node X509 authentication
@section X509 authentication

With X509 authentication smartcards need to be associated with X509
certicates.  This mapping is to be established through the ``url''
field on the OpenPGP smartcard.  The url field is expected to hold
either a valid LDAP url (``ldap://...'') or a file url
(``file:///...'').  After a certificate has been successfuly looked
up, it is validated through Dirmngr and a challenge-response
authentication is triggered against the smartcard.  The mapping
between smartcards and local accounts is established through the list
of email addresses contained in the certificate.  Through the
configuration file, Poldi is informed about the ``X509 domain'' to
use.  This domain is used when looking through the list of email
addresses for the local username on the system. Note: semantics might
change.

To illustrate this with an example: lets assume a user is trying to
authenticate himself trough Poldi's X509 method.  Poldi looks up the
url field of the user's smartcard and retrieves his X509 certificate.
The certificate contains two e-mail addresses: ``<dude@@example.com>''
and ``<fry@@gnupg.org>''.  Since the administrator set the ``X509
domain'' to ``gnupg.org'' in Poldi's configuration file, Poldi will
pick out the address ``fry@@gnupg.org'' and (after succesful
challenge-response authentication) will let the user login as ``fry''.

@node Installation from Source
@chapter Installation from Source

Building and installing Poldi from source should be pretty
straightforward, since it uses the GNU autotools.  Build- and runtime
dependencies may vary with the enabled authentication methods.

Independent from enabled authentication methods, Poldi depends on
Libgpg-error, Libgcrypt, Libassuan, Scdaemon and of course Libpam.

The ``X509'' authentication method additionaly has a build-time
dependency on libksba and requires Dirmngr to be properly setup at
runtime.  The ``local database'' authentication method has no
additional requirements.

Details on the building procedure can be found in the file
``INSTALL''.

At least one configure switch should be set:
@code{--with-pam-module-directory}, which specifies the installation
directory for PAM modules.  Alternatively one can copy the built PAM
module (named ``pam_poldi.so'') to the correct place manually.

For building the Poldi package, ``make'' needs to be invoked.

Installing Poldi works by invoking the ``install'' make target.  As
noted before, special care must be taken so that the PAM module ends up
in the correct place.

Poldi requires some directories beneath `SYSCONFDIR/poldi', which is
usually equal to `PREFIX/etc/poldi'. These directories can be created
manually or through the `install-conf-skeleton' make target.

@node Configuration
@chapter Configuration

Poldi can be configured through configuration files and through PAM
arguments.  All configuration files of Poldi are stored beneath
``@code{sysconfdir}/poldi''.

Poldi's main configuration file is
``@code{sysconfdir}/poldi/poldi.conf''.  The syntax of Poldi's
configuration file is identical to the one used by several other GnuPG
components; options and their values are written next to each other,
seperated by a whitespace - one such configuration item per line.

Poldi supports the following authentication method independent
options, which can be specified in the main configuration file and in
the PAM configuration files as arguments to the Poldi PAM module (with
standard doubledash notation).

@table @code
@item log-file FILENAME
Specify the file to use for log messages.
@item auth-method AUTH-METHOD
Specify the authentication method to use.  May be either ``localdb
or ``x509''.
@item debug
Enable debugging messages.
@end table

Further configuration depends on the authentication method to use.

@menu

* Configuration for ``X509'' authentication::
@end menu

@node Configuration for ``local-database'' authentication
@section Configuration for ``local-database'' authentication

For the local-database authentication method additional configuration
is required.  All local-database specific configuration files are
stored in the subdirectory ``localdb'':

@table @code
@item File: users
This file contains the mapping between smartcard serial numbers and
local usernames.  Syntax: this file consists of entries - one entry
per line.  Entries are of the form:
"<SERIALNO><WHITESPACES><USERNAME>\n" (without quotation marks and
without angle brackets.  Allowed whitespaces are spaces and tabs.
<SERIALNO> is the serial number of an OpenPGP smartcard as reported by
poldi-ctrl --print-serialno.  <USERNAME> is a valid username on the
system.  Comments are opened with "#" and terminated by a newline.

@item Directory: keys

This directory contains the "key database" for Poldis "local database"
authentication method.  When Poldi needs the key belonging to a given
smartcard serial number, it looks up a file in this directory whose
name is exactly the serial number.

Usually only the system administrator is able to modify this directory
and thus establish the mapping between smartcards and keys.  But it
might make sense for the administrator to make a file in this
directory writable for a ordinary user as well, since this would allow
that user to update his smartcard's key and adjust the mapping himself
without bothering the admin.
@end table


@node Configuration for ``X509'' authentication
@section Configuration for ``X509'' authentication

In case X509 authentication is enabled, Poldi tries to parse another
configuration file, namely ``poldi-x509.conf''.  The following
configuration options are supported for this configuration file:

@table @code
@item dirmngr-socket FILENAME
Specify the socket to be used for communication with Dirmngr.

@item x509-domain STRING
Specify the X509 domain, which is simply a suffix required for
recognizing email addresses contained in user certificates as
belonging to the system on which authentication happens.
@end table

@node Configuration Example
@chapter Configuration Example

@menu
* Example for ``local-database'' authentication::
* Example for ``X509'' authentication::
@end menu

@node Example for ``local-database'' authentication
@section Example for ``local-database'' authentication

Lets assume a new installation of Poldi into the root filesystem,
having configuration files stored beneath /etc/poldi. The user
``moritz'', who got an OpenPGP card with the serial number
``D2760001240101010001000006550000, would like to authenticate himself
through Poldi.

First, the system administrator has to associate the user moritz with
the card's serial number:

@example
$ echo "D2760001240101010001000006550000 moritz" >> /etc/poldi/localdb/users
@end example

Second, the system administrator needs to write the card's key into a
card-specific key file.  Therefore he inserts Moritz' smartcard and
executes:

@example
$ poldi-ctrl --print-key > /etc/poldi/localdb/keys/D2760001240101010001000006550000
@end example

The administrator wants to allow Moritz to update his card's key
himself; he/she types:

@example
$ chown moritz /etc/poldi/localdb/keys/D2760001240101010001000006550000
@end example

That's it.

@node Example for ``X509'' authentication
@section Example for ``X509'' authentication

Setting up X509 authentication is more complicated than setting up
localdb authentication, since more components are involved.  This
sections tries to explain the basic steps.

When using localdb authentication, all we need is a list of keys on
the system, against which the challenge-response authentication is
done.  For X509 authentication we need to:

@table @asis
@item ... create X509 certificates
one per smartcard, issued by a certificate authority trusted by Dirmngr
@item ... setup the smartcards
so that they ``point'' to ``their'' certificates
@item ... run Dirmngr
making it listen on a specific socket
@item ... setup Poldi
specifying Dirmngr's socket and the ``X509 domain'' in poldi-x509.conf.
@end table

Lets assume we don't have a certificate authority yet.  For the CA
administration one needs a CA program, like OpenSSL.  It can either be
used directly or through a GUI frontend like ``Tiny CA''.

FIXME: explain situation/goal (x509_domain).

Step 1: Create a CA.  I created my test CA with the following
settings:

@table @asis
@item Common Name: Fnord Inc CA
@item Country Name: DE
@item Organization Name: Fnord Inc
@item Organizational Unit: Testing
@end table

The other options required are rather self-explanitory.  After CA
creation, we need to generate a signing request.  For this,
gpgsm-gencert.sh can be used (after inserting the users smartcard and
running gpg-agent):

@example
$ gpgsm-gencert.sh

-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
$ 
@end example

Import the new certificate signing request in your CA and sign it,
yielding a new client certificate.  A note on Tiny CA: the program
defaults FIXME mail address.

Export both, the CA certificate and the client certificate, in DER
format.  Export a certificate revocation list (CRL) for your CA in DER
format.

Step 2: Setup OpenPGP smartcard

The OpenPGP smartcard is not a ``real'' PKCS#XYZ (FIXME?) smartcard -
it cannot store X509 certificates.  So instead of ``uploading'' the
certificate to the smartcard, we write an URL to the card, through
which the complete certificate can be retrieved.  Simply fill the
smartcard's ``url'' field with either a ``ldap://'' or a ``file://''
URL, pointing to the certificate.  For LDAP urls to work, the
certificate must be stored on a LDAP server and Dirmngr must be
configured to use that LDAP server.  For testing, one can simply
specify ``file:///some/where/cert-exported-from-ca.crt''.  Editing the
card's data fields is to be done through GnuPG:

@example
$ gpg --card-edit # (or gpg2)
@end example

Step 3: Setup Dirmngr.

For debugging purposes it is usually a good idea to add:
@example
debug-all
log-file /some/where/dirmngr.log
@end example

to dirmngr.conf.

Drop the exported CA certificate in Dirmngr's ``trusted-certs''
directory.

Now, run Dirmngr:

@example
$ eval $(dirmngr --socket /some/where/dirmngr.S --daemon)
@end example

and inform it about the CRL:

@example
$ dirmngr-client --load-crl previously-saved-crl.der
@end example

Check Dirmngr's log file for any errors.

Step 4: Configure Poldi.

Obviously, in the main configuration file poldi.conf, we need:

@example
auth-method x509
@end example

Again, it's a very good idea to also add:

@example
debug
log-file /some/where/poldi.og
@end example

Add the following to ``poldi-x509.conf'':

@example
dirmngr-socket /some/where/dirmngr.S # the socket name previously specified
x509-domain example.com
@end example

Now, things should be ready for trying authentication.

@node Testing
@chapter Testing

Authentication through Poldi should be tested before activating the
module.  For this purpose, the Poldi package includes a simple program
named ``pam-test'', which is suitable for testing PAM authentication.

@node Notes on Applications
@chapter Notes on Applications

Generally speaking, all applications containing a decent PAM
integration should work flawlessly in combination with Poldi.  Sadly,
there are applications out there, which do not use PAM correctly.
Therefore, they might work not too well in case they are configured to
use Poldi.

This chapter attempts to list the most common problems or useful hints
in respect to popular applications.

When applications still ask for e.g. a username although Poldi is
activated for that application, it might be the case that other
authentication modules, which trigger this kind of user interaction, are
configured to run prior to Poldi.

@menu

@end menu

@node login
@section login

The `login'-program contained in the `shadow'-package (>= v4.0.3) works
fine together with Poldi.

Usually login is launched by `getty', which might trigger user
interaction, which is not appropriate for use with Poldi (e.g., asking
for a username).  In this case, getty needs to be told to skip the task
of username querying.

The getty-program from the `util-linux'-package can be started with the
`-n' argument in order to not ask for a username.

@node su
@section su

The `su'-program contained in the `shadow'-package (>= v4.0.3) works
fine together with Poldi.

@node gdm
@section gdm

GDM contains two frontends, the `graphical greeter' and the `standard
greeter'.

At least the standard greeter can be used with Poldi just fine; the
graphical greeter obviously asks for usernames prior to triggering PAM
authentication.

@node XScreensaver
@section XScreensaver

XScreensaver (at least Version >= 5.07, possibly earlier versions too)
works quiet well with Poldi authentication.  By combining SCDaemons
~/.gnupg/scd-event mechanism with the xscreensaver-command program, one
can easily setup an environment in which the card-removal event triggers
screen locking and the card-insertion event triggers screen unlocking.

@node xdm
@section xdm

XDM does ask for usernames prior to triggering PAM authentication, as
such it is not too suitable for use with Poldi.

@node kdm
@section kdm

KDM asks for username and password in it's default configuration,
instead of implementing PAM correctly.
