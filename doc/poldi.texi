@node Overview
@section Overview

Poldi is package consisting of a PAM module (pam_poldi) and a CLI
program (poldi-ctrl) , which implement authentication via OpenPGP
smartcards (http://www.g10code.de/p-card.html).

@node Building
@section Building

Building Poldi should be pretty straightforward; Poldi depends on the
following packages: Libgcrypt, Libgpg-error.

Details on the build procedure can be found in the file ``INSTALL''.  At
least one configure switch should be set:
@code{--with-pam-module-directory}, which specifies the installation
directory for PAM modules.

@node Installing
@section Installing

Installing Poldi should not require more than an invocation of the
``install'' make target.

Poldi requires some directories beneath `SYSCONFDIR/poldi', which is
usually equal to `PREFIX/etc/poldi'.

The directories can be created manually or through the
`install-conf-skeleton' make target.

@node Using Poldi
@chapter Using Poldi

In this chapter you will find information on the correct configuration
and Usage of Poldi.

@menu
* Configuration::               Configuring Poldi
* Testing::                     Testing basic functionality
@end menu

@node Configuration
@section Configuration

All configuration files of Poldi are stored beneath
``@code{sysconfdir}/poldi''.

Poldi's main configuration file is
``@code{sysconfdir}/poldi/poldi.conf''.  The syntax of this
configuration file is identical to the one used by several other GnuPG
components; options, and their values, are written next each other,
seperated by a whitespace - one such configuration item per line.

Poldi supports the following options:

@table @code
@item ctapi-driver <driver name>
@item pcsc-driver <driver name>
@item reader-port <reader port>
@item disable-ccid
@item disable-opensc
@item debug-ccid-driver
@item logfile
@end table

The semantics used by Poldi in respect to choosing a default card
driver and handling of the card driver specific options should match
those of scdaemon.

The public keys are stored in files beneath the directory
``keys''. which are named after the card serial numbers.  These files
must contain the public key as a single S-Expression.

The mapping between keys and Unix accounts is to be established by
adding appropriate entries to the user database file named ``users''.
Such an entry has to be of the following form:

<card serial number> <white space(s)> <account>.

Maintaining the information in these files can be simplified by using
the Poldi maintaince tool.

An example follows.

The user ``bender'', who got a OpenPGP card with the serial number
``D2760001240101000001000000CF0000'', would like to authenticate
himself through Poldi.  First, the system administrator of the system
in question has to introduce ``bender'' to Poldi:

@example
$ poldi-ctrl --add-user --account bender --serialno D2760001240101000001000000CF0000.
@end example

That's it.  Now, bender has to write the public key of his OpenPGP
card into the appropriate key file:

@example
$ poldi-ctrl --set-key
@end example


@node Testing
@section Testing

After configuring Poldi properly, basic functionality should be tested
prior to integrating the PAM module into the system.

In order to test basic card access, poldi-ctrl can be used as follows
to dump information read from the card:

@example
$ poldi-ctrl --dump
@end example

After verifying the correct interaction with the card, poldi-ctrl
should be used to simulate an authentication mechanism:

@example
$ poldi-ctrl --test
@end example

If this works as well, Poldi should be ready for integration into the
PAM system.

@node Applications
@chapter Applications

Generally speaking, all applications containing a decent PAM integration
should work flawlessly in combination with Poldi.  Sadly, there are
applications out there, which do not use PAM as they should.  Therefore,
they might work not too well in case they are configured to use Poldi.

This chapter attempts to list the most common problems or useful hints
in respect to popular applications.

When applications still ask for e.g. a username although Poldi is
activated for that application, it might be the case that other
authentication modules, which trigger this kind of user interaction, are
run prior to Poldi.

* su::
* gdm::
* xdm::
@end menu

@node login
@section login

The `login'-program contained in the `shadow'-package (>= v4.0.3) works
fine together with Poldi.

Usually login is launched by `getty', which might trigger user
interaction, which is not appropriate for use with Poldi (e.g., asking
for a username).  In this case, getty needs to be told to skip the task
of username querying.

The getty-program from the `util-linux'-package can be started with the
`-n' argument in order to not ask for a username.

@node su
@section su

The `su'-program contained in the `shadow'-package (>= v4.0.3) works
fine together with Poldi.

@node gdm
@section gdm

GDM contains two frontends, the `graphical greeter' and the `standard
greeter'.

At least the standard greeter can be used with Poldi just fine; the
graphical greeter obviously asks for usernames prior to triggering PAM
authentication.

@node xdm
@section xdm

XDM does ask for usernames prior to triggering PAM authentication, as
such it is not too suitable for use with Poldi.
