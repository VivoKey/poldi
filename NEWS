Changes since version 0.3:

* SCdaemon support
  Poldi internals rewritten: uses the scdaemon from now on instead of
  talking to the smartcard directly

Changes since version 0.2:

* Smartcard to account mapping:
  In the past, Poldi implemented a 1:1 mapping between smartcards and
  system accounts.  As of now, Poldi implements a M:N mapping, meaning
  that one user can have multiple cards and that several users can
  share a card.

  Instead of "add-user" and "remove-user" commands we now have:
   - "register-card"
   - "unregister-card"
   - "list-cards"
   - "associate"
   - "disassociate".

* Better support for Version 0x0101 cards:
  no Admin PIN necessary for public key retrival.

* Work around a problem in libpam_misc, which causes the PIN prompt to
  appear to late.

* Improved documentation.

* Support for creating a skeleton configuration hierarchy.

* Support for a timeout while waiting for smartcard insertion.

* Removed `fake-wait-for-card'-feature.

* Dropped ugly `install-pam-module' mechanism; now the PAM module gets
  installed automatically during `make install'.

* Improved error reporting.

* Code cleanup: heavily improved code documentation.
