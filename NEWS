Changes since version 0.3:

* Many parts have been rewritten and/or reorganized

* GPLv3+
  Changed License to GPL v3 or later.

* SCdaemon support
  Poldi uses the scdaemon from now on instead of talking to the
  smartcard directly.

* Authentication methods
  Implemented abstraction layer for "authentication methods".  The
  previous authentication process is now encapsulated in an
  authentication method named "localdb".

* X509
  Added another authentication method named "x509", which interacts
  with Dirmngr in order to provide authentication through a X509 PKI.

* i18n
  Added support for internationalization.
  Added german translation.

Changes since version 0.2:

* Smartcard to account mapping:
  In the past, Poldi implemented a 1:1 mapping between smartcards and
  system accounts.  As of now, Poldi implements a M:N mapping, meaning
  that one user can have multiple cards and that several users can
  share a card.

  Instead of "add-user" and "remove-user" commands we now have:
   - "register-card"
   - "unregister-card"
   - "list-cards"
   - "associate"
   - "disassociate".

* Better support for Version 0x0101 cards:
  no Admin PIN necessary for public key retrival.

* Work around a problem in libpam_misc, which causes the PIN prompt to
  appear to late.

* Improved documentation.

* Support for creating a skeleton configuration hierarchy.

* Support for a timeout while waiting for smartcard insertion.

* Removed `fake-wait-for-card'-feature.

* Dropped ugly `install-pam-module' mechanism; now the PAM module gets
  installed automatically during `make install'.

* Improved error reporting.

* Code cleanup: heavily improved code documentation.
