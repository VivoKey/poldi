Changes since version 0.2:

* Better support for Version 0x0101 cards (no Admin PIN necessary for
  public key retrival).

* Work around a problem in libpam_misc, which causes the PIN prompt to
  appear to late.

* Improved documentation.

* Support for creating a skeleton configuration hierarchy.

* Support for a timeout while waiting for smartcard insertion.

* Removed `fake-wait-for-card'-feature.

* Dropped ugly `install-pam-module' mechanism; now the PAM module gets
  installed automatically during `make install'.

* Improved error reporting.
