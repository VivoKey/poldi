Migration from Poldi 0.3
========================

Several things have changed with the release of Poldi 0.4.  This
document explains how to upgrade smoothly from Poldi 0.3 to Poldi 0.4.

* Authentication Methods

  Poldi 0.3 only supported one mechanism to authenticate a user: a
  challenge-response protocol in combination with a smartcard<-->user
  mapping stored in a plain text file.
