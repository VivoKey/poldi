Dunno:
* dirmngr!

Final:
* allow for Dirmngr to be started on demand (in pipe mode) (NO <- Why?!)

Low priority:
* poldi mit anderen karten!
* figure out what exactly the dependencies on the OpenPGP smartcard are.
* improve doc
* work on MIGRATION text
* fix install-conf-skeleton (does nothing for x509?)
* better (new?) error codes
* poldi-ctrl --print-config?
* verify we don't need pam_sm_setcred; i still don't get what this
  call is needed for - most PAM modules in Linux-PAM implement it as a
  dummy.
* Note: currently Poldi ignores the expired flag on authentication keys.
* poldi shouldn't contain any global state (explain why), reference
  needed: as far as i understand it, PAM modules should be rather
  reentrant; at least thread safe.  so that applications do can call
  pam_authenticate without danger.
* conf skeleton for x509 method?
* decide on pam-poldi.h common header file for all poldi sources
* add logging prefix "[Poldi]" automatically? how about conv calls?
* do we want to respect conv_tell error codes or should it be void?
* give user a chance to enter PIN twice?
!* PIN-less authentication mechanism?
* check if information on Applications in the manual are still uptodate.
!* figure what needs to be done for enabling LTSP logins through Poldi (interesting!)
* allow user to override scdaemon to use through environment variables
  or something (probably required for ltsp).
* print signature counter on login?
!* what does "6 characters minimum" mean in openpgp-card.pdf? is it "bytes" or really "utf8 characters"?
* shall we really forbid to use non-digit characters in PIN?
* improve/verify internatinalization
* implement command in poldi-ctrl for toggling the AuthWithoutPin-Flag

High priority:
* general audit
* i18n, gettext??
* verify it works in keypad mode
* verify changes to logging.c (related to syslog) are okay.
