Dunno:

Documentation:

* improve doc
* decide on naming convention for conf files in Poldi manual
* write tutorial on migration from poldi 0.3 to poldi 0.4/0.5.

Low priority:

* better (new?) error codes
* poldi-ctrl --print-config?
* verify we don't need pam_sm_setcred
* poldi shouldn't contain any global state (explain why), reference needed
* figure out what exactly the dependencies on the OpenPGP smartcard are.
* conf skeleton for x509 method?
* decide on pam-poldi.h common header file for all poldi sources
* add logging prefix "[Poldi]" automatically? how about conv calls?
* do we want to respect conv_tell error codes or should it be void?
* give user a chance to enter PIN twice?
* PIN-less authentication mechanism?
* check if information on Applications in the manual are still uptodate.

High priority:
* strip/cleanup getpin-cb.c?
* audit: scd.c
* i18n, gettext??
* clearify: are there any problems with PAM in respect to serialization?
* cleanup/verify scd_pksign()
