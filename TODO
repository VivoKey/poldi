Dunno:
* dirmngr!

Final:
* poldi mit anderen karten!
* allow for Dirmngr to be started on demand (in pipe mode) (NO <- Why?!)

Low priority:
* decide on naming convention for conf files in Poldi manual
* improve doc
* work on MIGRATION text
* fix install-conf-skeleton (does nothing for x509?)
* better (new?) error codes
* poldi-ctrl --print-config?
* verify we don't need pam_sm_setcred
* poldi shouldn't contain any global state (explain why), reference needed
!* figure out what exactly the dependencies on the OpenPGP smartcard are.
* conf skeleton for x509 method?
* decide on pam-poldi.h common header file for all poldi sources
* add logging prefix "[Poldi]" automatically? how about conv calls?
* do we want to respect conv_tell error codes or should it be void?
* give user a chance to enter PIN twice?
!* PIN-less authentication mechanism?
* check if information on Applications in the manual are still uptodate.
!* figure what needs to be done for enabling LTSP logins through Poldi (interesting!)
* allow user to override scdaemon to use through environment variables
  or something (probably required for ltsp).
* print signature counter on login?
!* what does "6 characters minimum" mean in openpgp-card.pdf? is it "bytes" or really "utf8 characters"?
* shall we really forbid to use non-digit characters in PIN?

High priority:
* getpin/pincb interface: info strings?  tell user about CHV number?
* strip/cleanup getpin-cb.c?
* audit: scd.c
* i18n, gettext??
* clearify: are there any problems with PAM in respect to serialization?
* cleanup/verify scd_pksign()
* verify it works in keypad mode (this needs more thinking, since we
  do not use the pinentry in poldi)
